### Leading the low code revolution...

**Low code's goal is high development productivity, efficiency and
effectiveness.**

Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.

The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[3][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.

DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[4] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007, some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

## What are the 10 Pillars of Low Code

### The low code approach...


> 1.	Agile Flavor with Remote + WAH development
>> 1.1.	Iterative
> 2.	Intercept / Observe
> 3.	Admin
> 4.	Team Player, e.g. UX
> 5.	Learn Quickly
> 6.	SEO
> 7.	No Negativity Towards DRY
> 8.	Coming Technical Apocalypse
>> 8.1.	(a) e.g. mount (b) auth
> 9.	Security
> 10.	Benchmarking



## Agile is Not Agile Enough
### Flash teams – aims to integrate remote and WAH...

## Engage Teams with Users
### User videos and/or bits and bytes debates...
![](media/bg1a.png)


## Don’t Build the App!
### Build the 'automatic' app, that builds your app. Like SR-71...

**Admin Tools**

## Don’t Use CSS!
### Work with team especially your designers...

## ‘Google’ for Framework
### You can customize...

## Cheaper AND Faster!
### No need for HTTPS certs...
![](media/bg25.png)


## Code Anywhere
### Dev for remote team players – add to local dev environment...
